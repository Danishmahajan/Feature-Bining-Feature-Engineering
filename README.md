# Feature_Bining

*Binning or discretization is used for the transformation of a continuous or numerical variable into a categorical feature. Binning of continuous variable introduces non-linearity and tends to improve the performance of the model. It can be also used to identify missing values or outliers.
There are two types of binning:
-Unsupervised Binning: Equal width binning, Equal frequency binning
-Supervised Binning: Entropy-based binning
