# Feature_Bining

* Feature binning is a method of turning continuous variables into categorical values using pre-defined number of bins. It is effective when a continuous feature has too many unique values or few extreme values outside the expected range. Such extreme values influence on the trained model, thereby affecting the prediction accuracy of the model. It can be also used to identify missing values or outliers.

## There are two types of binning:
###  Unsupervised Binning :
1. Equal width binning<br>
2. Equal frequency binning<br>

### Supervised Binning:

1. Entropy-based binning
